Monolithic Architecture ---
All UI, Backend, DB in same place.
If changes are done in one app, all will be deployed again. 

MicroServices ---
Separation of Concerns
Single Responsibility Principle
All these services talk to each other
UI - React, Angular
Backend - Java, Python
All services run on a specific port --- UI on 1234, Backend on 1235
All are deployed on same domain in the end
/api - Backend
/auth - UI
/login - Database

useEffect Hook - 
called after the render cycle of the Body component is completed
Page Loads --> Render Shimmer UI --> API Fetch call --> Render on UI

CORS Policy - 
Calling Swiggy API from Localhost has been blocked due to Cors Policy
Browsers block API to call from one origin to another origin

How to Bypass CORS Error - 
CORS Chrome extensions
Or you can use proxy

Why to use useState Hook ?
Because normal javascript variable will not update DOM and will not re-render the whole component 
if the state of the variable is updated.
Whole component is updated when a state variable is updated, then it matches diff and update it
