GIT STEPS -
Make a repository on GITHUB and make it public'
git init - To make our local a git repo (.git file will be generated) (-U will appear in VS Code)
git branch -M main - (It will change default master branch to main)
git add . - Combines all files together
git commit -m "Pushing episode-01"
git remote add origin "<url>" - Configure local repo to remote repo
git push origin main - pushed the code
For verification, you should see 100% done in the  GIT Terminal 

NPM -
It is not Node Package Manager
It is a package manager
It is a standard repository for all the packages
Any package you need to include in your project, we use NPM

HOW TO ADD NPM TO OUR PROJECT ? 
npm init 
answer few questions
For verification, Package.json file will be created 
Package.json file is the configuration for our NPM

WHAT RE BUNDLERS? 
Bundler is the one that minifize the files to make the roject ready for production
For eg. WebPack, Parcel, weet
We will use Parcel here in this project
In Create React App, WebPack is used

TYPES OF DEPENDENCIES ---
1. DEPENDENCIES (For production) (npm install parcel)
2. DEV DEPENDENCIES (required For development) (npm install -D parcel)

PACKAGE.JSON?
It stores the details of the dependencies and their version (using a caret or tilde)
We prefer caret (~) bcoz it will update according to the minor version updates.

PACKAGE-LOCK.JSON ? 
It stores the exact version that we used in development phase, so that it does not cause 
any issues in the production phase.

NODE MODULES ? 
Node modules is like a database for all the libraries

TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCIES? 
Parcel may need some other library, which intentionally needs some other library, due to which
Node modules keep all the libraries at once in our project

npx parcel index.html - Parcel will build a development build and will host it to server
npm - installing a package
npx - executing a package

It created a server for us - localhost:1234
