Hello world from Javascript ---
Create a heading vriable first
Then point it back to root element
root.appendChild(heading)

INJECTING REACT INTO OUR PROJECT --->
CDN Links - Content delivery networks
We pull react library which are hosted on this link
These CDN Links are just plain javascript code

HOW TO VERIFY IF YOU HAVE INJECTED REACT SUCCESFULLY OR NOT ? 
Go to UI, on the Inspect -> Console, type "React" and "ReactDOM", you must see a lot of functions that are provided by React.

WHY THERE ARE 2 REACT CDN LINKS? 
1. React.development - This is the core of react
2. React.dom.development - 
This file is required to modify the DOM (Document Object Model)
We have different types of React - React Native, React 3D..
So, this link is to tell what work we want to do with React here

HELLO WORLD USING REACT ---
<script>
        const heading = React.createElement("h1", {id:"heading", xyz: "abc"}, "Hello world from React");
        // here heading is just a normal javascript object
        const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
        root.render(heading);
        // render method converts javascript object into html tag and append it in DOM
</script>

The above code becomes very untidy, so we have JSK to make our lives easier.

Order of the files present in index.html file, matter - 
1. React.js
2. ReactDOM.js
3. script - App.js
