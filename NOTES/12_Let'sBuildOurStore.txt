REDUX ---

Redux is not mandatory
Redux is a separate state management library
We also have Zustand - another state managemement library

Other libraries - 
Vanilla redux - old way of redux - way too complicated
React Redux
Redux toolkit - newer way of writing redux (standard way)

There can bemultiple slices of redux store - 
Cart slice
user slice
theme slice

REDUX THEORY - 

WRITING TO THE REDUX STORE ---
Click on ADD Button
Dispatches an action
Calls a reducer function
updates one slice of the cart 

READING FROM THE REDUX STORE ---
Header component is subscribing to the redux store
Using a selector
Header component will be updated with the new data

REDUX TOOLKIT STEPS ---
Install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux
Build our store
Connect our store to our app
Slice(cartslice)
Dispatch(action)
selector

Optimizing the redux performance ---

Subscribe to a small portion of store
Mutating the state ---
Older redux - don't mutate the state, create a copy and return the copy
Newer redux - we have to mutate the state
Newer redux Toolkit uses Immer js Library to calculate diff and mutate the state and return the new state

RTK Says - either mutate the state or return a new state
state.items.length=0
(OR)
return {items: []}

REDUX DEV TOOLS ---
Chrome extension

RTK Query - is used to fetch data (make API Calls)
Previously, we had Redux middlewares or thunk for this
