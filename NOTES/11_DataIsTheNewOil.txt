Higher Order Component ---
A component which takes another component as an Input and enhances it and then returns a component

Install React Developer Tools Chrome extension
In inspect - you will get Components and Profiler

Components - 
Left side - Virtual DOM (UI Layer)
Right side - props (Data layer)

Profiler - records your react application
Whatever action you perform, it will give the time of rendering and the whole routes you navigated

Controlled and Uncontrolled components ---
Restaurant menu is passing the state t res category - so res category is a controlled component

Modifying the state variable of parent ---
not possible directly, but indirectly we can do that
This is called lifting the state up 

Props Drilling ---
When props get passed to hierarchial components 
even though there was no need of those props

CONTEXT ---
create CONTEXT
use CONTEXT
Here, keep only the data that you used at multiple places

2 Usages of context - 
1. using hooks
2. using context.consumer

<UserContext.Consumer>
{(data) => console.log(data)}
</UserContext.Consumer>

Modifying the context value ---
<UserContext.Provider value={Diksha}>
// Diksha (whole app)
<UserContext.Provider value={Tamanna}>
//Tamanna (Header)
<UserContext.Provider value={Debdeepa}>
// Debdeepa (Restaurant Card)
</UserContext.Provider>
</UserContext.Provider>
</UserContext.Provider>

You can modify only a single piece of application, whereever you wrap context.provider
