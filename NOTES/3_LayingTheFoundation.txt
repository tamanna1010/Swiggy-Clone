How to start React app? 
In package.json file, add scripts file - 
"start": "parcel index.html",
"build": "parcel build index.html"
Then on the terminal, run "npm run start"

JSX - 
Jsx is not HMTL Inside JS, JSX is not HMTL
ISX is HTML/XML like syntax, which makes developers life easy
jsx element === react.createElement (Both are objects)
JSX is not understood by JS Engine/ Browsers
JSX Will takes camelCase attributes

Babel - Javascript compiler / Javascript transpiler
JSX is transpiled first, then it reaches to JS Engine (Done by Babel (which came by Parcel))
Babel is a package installed by Parcel
Babel converts ES6 Syntax into the syntax that browser understands
JSX - Transpiled - React.createElement - Object creation - root.render - then becomes a tag

TYPES OF COMPONENTS - 
1. Class Based Component
2. Functioal Component

FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT - It is a normal javascript function which returns a piece of JSX Code
Syntax - Both the below syntax are same only
1. const head = () => {
    return <h1>Hey...</h1>
}
(OR)
2. const haeding = () => (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
)

COMPONENT COMPOSITION - 
<Title/> - compoennt - <Title></Title> - {Title()}
{title} - element
{} - we can write any Javascript code inside curly brackets

CROSS SITE SCRIPTING - 
Through the API Call, any bad API can inject a piece of code onto your browser to stole cookies, local storage,
session storage to get some info about personal details
JSX Prevents this attack in {}, hence we can freely use it, JSX will take care of the injection attacks.
